Code repository for the manuscript: *Nucleotide dependency analysis of DNA language models reveals genomic functional elements*

## Description

This repository contains code to compute and visualize nucleotide dependencies using DNA language models. The notebook `compute_and_visualize_dep_maps.ipynb`, includes examples and code to:

- Visualize nucleotide dependency maps for a specific sequence and DNA Language Model
- Compute variant influence scores for a specific sequence and DNA Language Model

## Requirements

SpeciesLM and RiNALMo models require FlashAttention-2 to be installed (https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).
